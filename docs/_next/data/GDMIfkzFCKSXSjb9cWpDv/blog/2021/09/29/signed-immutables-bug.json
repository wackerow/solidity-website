{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","published":true,"title":"Signed Immutables Bug","date":"2021-09-29","author":"Solidity Team","category":"Security Alerts"},"content":"\nOn September 28th, 2021, the Solidity team discovered that\nfor immutable variables of a signed integer type shorter than 256 bits,\nsign extension (cleanup) of its value is not always properly performed.\n\nTo our knowledge, the value can only be accessed in its unclean state\nwhen using inline assembly.\nThe bug is present since the introduction of the\n`immutable` feature in Solidity 0.6.5 and is fixed in 0.8.9.\n\nWe assigned the bug a severity of \"very low\".\n\n## Technical Details\n\nWhen immutable variables are assigned in Solidity during the construction phase, the value\nis stored in memory until the creation concludes. For types shorter than 32 bytes,\nthese values were stored left-aligned within the 32 byte word and when the values were\nread again, they were shifted back accordingly, but no cleanup was performed on the values.\nIn particular, the signextend operation was not performed on signed values.\n\nAs an example, if you store `-2` in an `int8`, it is stored in two's complement encoding\nas a single-byte value of `0xfe`. Since the words in the EVM use 32 bytes, the value\nneeds to be properly sign-extended before an operation like signed division is performed,\notherwise the value would be interpreted as a positive value.\n\nSign-extension means setting the higher order bits to the same value as the\nsign bit, which is the most significant bit of the actual type.\n\nThe value `-2` represented as a two's complement in 32 bits (`int8`) is\n`0xfe`, however, in EVM, it is sign extended to\n`0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe`,\nwhich also represents the value `-2` when interpreted as `int256`.\nNote that `0xfe` when interpreted as `int256` is `+254`.\n\nThe missing sign extension was not discovered earlier, since Solidity always performs\nadditional cleanup (which can be removed by the optimizer if done twice)\nright before an operation where it is important to have clean higher order bits\nlike copying to memory, comparing or dividing values.\n\nSo the only way\n(to our knowledge) to obtain the \"unclean\" value of the immutable is to first\nassign it to a local variable and then read from that local variable\ninside inline assembly.\n\n## Affected Example\n\nIn the example below, the call to `f()` returns `0x000000...0000fe` instead of\n`0xffffff...fffffe`.\n\n```solidity\ncontract C {\n    int8 immutable x = -2;\n    function f() public view returns (bytes32 r) {\n        int8 y = x;\n        assembly { r := y }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you use something like `r = bytes32(int(y));` to return the value without\ninline assembly, it would return the correct value. The same is true when using\na getter - `int8 public immutable x = -2`.\n\n## Justification for Inline Assembly to be Required\n\nWe believe that inline assembly is required for this bug to manifest itself, not only\nbecause we believe that the Solidity compiler always properly cleans the values\nwhenever it matters, but also for another reason:\n\nThe bug is only present in what we call the \"legacy\" code generator. Cleanup when\nreading immutable values has been correctly implemented in the new Yul-IR-based\ncode generator (which is still considered experimental).\n\nIn order to find bugs in the new implementation, we regularly fuzz-test\nthe two implementations against each other using a mix of generational\n(Solidity programs generated based on language grammar) and mutational\n(mutated variants of existing Solidity programs) test creation engines.\n\nThis mechanism can of course not only find bugs in the new implementation,\nbut also in the old one.\n\nInline assembly is currently not used by the generational engine because\nwe know that the two implementations diverge on the assembly level\nand it would lead to too many false positives.\n\nSince the fuzzer has not found the bug in the almost 18 months it has been\npart of the compiler, we are pretty sure that there is no other way\nthan inline assembly to access the unclean values.\n","availableURLs":["/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement","/2023/03/10/solidity-developer-survey-2022-results","/2023/02/22/user-defined-operators","/2023/02/22/solidity-0.8.19-release-announcement","/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement","/2022/12/07/solidity-developer-survey-2022-announcement","/2022/12/05/solidity-core-team-updates","/2022/09/08/storage-write-removal-before-conditional-termination","/2022/09/08/solidity-0.8.17-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/calldata-tuple-reencoding-head-overflow-bug","/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement","/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug","/2022/06/15/dirty-bytes-array-to-storage-bug","/2022/05/17/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement","/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug","/2022/05/17/calldata-reencode-size-check-bug","/2022/05/03/solidity-summit-2022-recap","/2022/04/08/announcing-the-underhanded-contest-winners-2022","/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement","/2022/03/16/encodecall-bug","/2022/02/22/solidity-summit-2022-announcement","/2022/02/16/solidity-0.8.12-release-announcement","/2022/02/09/underhanded-solidity-contest-2022-announcement","/2022/02/07/solidity-developer-survey-2021-results","/2021/12/20/solidity-0.8.11-release-announcement","/2021/11/18/solidity-developer-survey-2021","/2021/11/09/solidity-0.8.10-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/user-defined-value-types-bug","/2021/09/29/solidity-0.8.9-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/signed-immutables-bug","/2021/09/27/user-defined-value-types","/2021/09/27/solidity-0.8.8-release-announcement","/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement","/2021/06/22/solidity-0.8.6-release-announcement","/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement","/2021/05/03/soliditylangorg-umbrella-domain","/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement","/2021/04/21/decoding-from-memory-bug","/2021/04/21/custom-errors","/2021/04/01/announcing-solidity-collectibles","/2021/03/23/solidity-0.8.3-release-announcement","/2021/03/23/keccak-optimizer-bug","/2021/03/02/solidity-0.8.2-release-announcement","/2021/03/02/saving-gas-with-simple-inliner","/2021/02/15/contributing-to-solidity-101","/2021/02/10/an-introduction-to-soliditys-fuzz-testing-approach","/2021/02/01/launching-the-solidity-forum","/2021/01/27/solidity-0.8.1-release-announcement","/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results","/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement","/2020/12/16/solidity-0.7.6-release-announcement","/2020/12/09/solidity-developer-survey-2020","/2020/12/03/solidity-underhanded-contest-winners","/2020/11/18/solidity-0.7.5-release-announcement","/2020/11/04/solidity-ama-1-recap","/2020/10/28/solidity-0.8.x-preview","/2020/10/19/solidity-0.7.4-release-announcement","/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-0.7.3-release-announcement","/2020/09/28/solidity-0.7.2-release-announcement","/2020/09/21/solidity-underhanded-contest","/2020/09/18/meet-the-team","/2020/09/02/solidity-0.7.1-release-announcement","/2020/07/28/solidity-v0.7.0-release-announcement","/2020/07/22/Solidity-0612-release-announcement","/2020/07/08/solidity-turns-5","/2020/07/07/Solidity-0611-release-announcement","/2020/06/25/sourcify-faq","/2020/06/18/solidity-0.6-inheritance","/2020/06/11/Solidity-0610-release-announcement","/2020/06/09/solidity-summit-recap","/2020/06/05/Solidity-069-release-announcement","/2020/06/02/Sourcify-Towards-Safer-Contract-Interaction-for-Humans","/2020/05/26/array-slices","/2020/05/14/Solidity-068-release-announcement","/2020/05/13/immutable-keyword","/2020/05/04/solidity-0.6.7-release-announcement","/2020/04/17/Solidity-Summit-2020-Goes-Interspace","/2020/04/09/solidity-0.6.6-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/solidity-0.6.5-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug","/2020/03/23/fallback-receive-split","/2020/03/17/solidity-0.5.17-release-announcement","/2020/03/10/solidity-0.6.4-release-announcement","/2020/02/18/solidity-0.6.3-release-announcement","/2020/01/29/solidity-0.6-try-catch","/2020/01/27/solidity-0.6.2-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.6.1-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.5.16-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.6.0-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.5.15-release-announcement","/2019/12/09/solidity-0.5.14-release-announcement","/2019/11/14/solidity-0.5.13-release-announcement","/2019/10/01/solidity-0.5.12-release-announcement","/2019/08/12/solidity-0.5.11-release-announcement","/2019/06/25/solidity-storage-array-bugs","/2019/06/25/solidity-0.5.10-release-announcement","/2019/05/28/solidity-0.5.9-release-announcement","/2019/04/30/solidity-0.5.8-release-announcement","/2019/04/29/solidity-0.4.26-release-announcement","/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug","/2019/03/26/solidity-0.5.7-release-announcement","/2019/03/13/solidity-0.5.6-release-announcemen
