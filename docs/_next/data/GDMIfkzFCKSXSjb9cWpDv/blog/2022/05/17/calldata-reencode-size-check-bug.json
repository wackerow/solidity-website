{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","published":true,"title":"Size Check Bug in Nested Calldata Array ABI-Reencoding","date":"2022-05-17","author":"Solidity Team","category":"Security Alerts"},"content":"\nOn April 7, 2022, a bug in the Solidity code generator was reported by\nJohn Toman of the Certora development team. Certora's bug disclosure post can be found [here](https://medium.com/certora/incorrect-calldata-validation-in-inter-contract-communication-certora-bug-disclosure-8a467ce92ca3).\n\nThe bug is fixed with [Solidity version 0.8.14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.14)\nreleased on May 17, 2022. The bug was first introduced in Solidity version 0.5.8.\n\nWe assigned the bug a severity of \"very low\".\n\n## Which Contracts are Affected?\n\nYou might be affected if you pass a nested array directly to another external\nfunction call or use `abi.encode` on it.\n\nIf calldata is malformed in a certain way, the call might not revert as it should.\nInstead, data with extra zeros at the end is passed on to the called contract or to the `abi.encode` function.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nCalldata validation for nested dynamic types is deferred until the first access\nto the nested values. Such an access may for example be a copy to memory or an\nindex or member access to the outer type. While in most such accesses calldata\nvalidation correctly checks that the data area of the nested array (see [the ABI\nencoding specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html#use-of-dynamic-types))\nis completely contained in the passed calldata (i.e. in\nthe range `[0, calldatasize()]`), this check may not be performed, when ABI\nencoding such nested types again directly from calldata.\n\nFor instance, this can happen, if a value in calldata with a nested dynamic array is\npassed to an external call, used in `abi.encode` or emitted as event.\nIn such cases, if the data area of the nested array extends beyond `calldatasize()`,\nABI encoding it did not revert, but continued reading values from beyond\n`calldatasize()` (i.e. zero values).\n\nFor example, in this contract:\n\n```solidity\ncontract C {\n\tevent e(uint[][]);\n\tfunction g(uint[][] calldata) external { ... }\n\tfunction f(uint[][] calldata a) external pure {\n\t\tbytes memory data = abi.encode(a);\n\t\tthis.g(a);\n\t\temit e(a);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nA call to `f` with corrupted calldata, in which an element of `a` has a data area that extends\nbeyond `calldatasize`, will not revert.\n\nHowever, each of the following cases will properly validate against `calldatasize` and will revert\nwith similarly corrupted calldata. This is because the calldata array is only being decoded rather than\ndecoded and encoded back in a single operation. This is handled by a different code path in the compiler that\nis unaffected by this bug:\n\n```solidity\ncontract C {\n\tfunction f1(uint[][] calldata a) external pure {\n\t\ta[0]; // Where a[0] is the element that extends beyond ``calldatasize``.\n\t}\n\tuint[][] s;\n\tfunction f2(uint[][] calldata a) external pure {\n\t\ts = a;\n\t}\n\tfunction f2(uint[][] calldata a) external pure {\n\t\tuint[][] memory x = a;\n\t}\n}\n```\n","availableURLs":["/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement","/2023/03/10/solidity-developer-survey-2022-results","/2023/02/22/user-defined-operators","/2023/02/22/solidity-0.8.19-release-announcement","/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement","/2022/12/07/solidity-developer-survey-2022-announcement","/2022/12/05/solidity-core-team-updates","/2022/09/08/storage-write-removal-before-conditional-termination","/2022/09/08/solidity-0.8.17-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/calldata-tuple-reencoding-head-overflow-bug","/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement","/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug","/2022/06/15/dirty-bytes-array-to-storage-bug","/2022/05/17/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement","/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug","/2022/05/17/calldata-reencode-size-check-bug","/2022/05/03/solidity-summit-2022-recap","/2022/04/08/announcing-the-underhanded-contest-winners-2022","/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement","/2022/03/16/encodecall-bug","/2022/02/22/solidity-summit-2022-announcement","/2022/02/16/solidity-0.8.12-release-announcement","/2022/02/09/underhanded-solidity-contest-2022-announcement","/2022/02/07/solidity-developer-survey-2021-results","/2021/12/20/solidity-0.8.11-release-announcement","/2021/11/18/solidity-developer-survey-2021","/2021/11/09/solidity-0.8.10-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/user-defined-value-types-bug","/2021/09/29/solidity-0.8.9-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/signed-immutables-bug","/2021/09/27/user-defined-value-types","/2021/09/27/solidity-0.8.8-release-announcement","/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement","/2021/06/22/solidity-0.8.6-release-announcement","/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement","/2021/05/03/soliditylangorg-umbrella-domain","/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement","/2021/04/21/decoding-from-memory-bug","/2021/04/21/custom-errors","/2021/04/01/announcing-solidity-collectibles","/2021/03/23/solidity-0.8.3-release-announcement","/2021/03/23/keccak-optimizer-bug","/2021/03/02/solidity-0.8.2-release-announcement","/2021/03/02/saving-gas-with-simple-inliner","/2021/02/15/contributing-to-solidity-101","/2021/02/10/an-introduction-to-soliditys-fuzz-testing-approach","/2021/02/01/launching-the-solidity-forum","/2021/01/27/solidity-0.8.1-release-announcement","/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results","/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement","/2020/12/16/solidity-0.7.6-release-announcement","/2020/12/09/solidity-developer-survey-2020","/2020/12/03/solidity-underhanded-contest-winners","/2020/11/18/solidity-0.7.5-release-announcement","/2020/11/04/solidity-ama-1-recap","/2020/10/28/solidity-0.8.x-preview","/2020/10/19/solidity-0.7.4-release-announcement","/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-0.7.3-release-announcement","/2020/09/28/solidity-0.7.2-release-announcement","/2020/09/21/solidity-underhanded-contest","/2020/09/18/meet-the-team","/2020/09/02/solidity-0.7.1-release-announcement","/2020/07/28/solidity-v0.7.0-release-announcement","/2020/07/22/Solidity-0612-release-announcement","/2020/07/08/solidity-turns-5","/2020/07/07/Solidity-0611-release-announcement","/2020/06/25/sourcify-faq","/2020/06/18/solidity-0.6-inheritance","/2020/06/11/Solidity-0610-release-announcement","/2020/06/09/solidity-summit-recap","/2020/06/05/Solidity-069-release-announcement","/2020/06/02/Sourcify-Towards-Safer-Contract-Interaction-for-Humans","/2020/05/26/array-slices","/2020/05/14/Solidity-068-release-announcement","/2020/05/13/immutable-keyword","/2020/05/04/solidity-0.6.7-release-announcement","/2020/04/17/Solidity-Summit-2020-Goes-Interspace","/2020/04/09/solidity-0.6.6-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/solidity-0.6.5-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug","/2020/03/23/fallback-receive-split","/2020/03/17/solidity-0.5.17-release-announcement","/2020/03/10/solidity-0.6.4-release-announcement","/2020/02/18/solidity-0.6.3-release-announcement","/2020/01/29/solidity-0.6-try-catch","/2020/01/27/solidity-0.6.2-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.6.1-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.5.16-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.6.0-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.5.15-release-announcement","/2019/12/09/solidity-0.5.14-release-announcement","/2019/11/14/solidity-0.5.13-release-announcement","/2019/10/01/solidity-0.5.12-release-announcement","/2019/08/12/solidity-0.5.11-release-announcement","/2019/06/25/solidity-storage-array-bugs","/2019/06/25/solidity-0.5.10-release-announcement","/2019/05/28/solidity-0.5.9-release-announcement","/2019/04/30/solidity-0.5.8-release-announcement","/2019/04/29/solidity-0.4.26-release-announcement","/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug","/2019/03/26/solidity-0.5.7-release-announcement","/2019/03/13/solidity-0.5.6-release-ann
