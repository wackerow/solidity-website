{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","published":true,"title":"Solidity 0.8.17 Release Announcement","date":"2022-09-08","author":"Solidity Team","category":"Releases"},"content":"\n[Solidity v0.8.17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.17)\nfixes an important bug, makes overflow checks on multiplication more efficient and adds an LSP feature to\nalways analyze all files in a project.\n\n## Important Bugs\n\n### Storage Write Removal Bug On Conditional Early Termination\n\nThe bug may result in storage writes being incorrectly considered redundant and removed by the optimizer.\nThe problem manifests in presence of assembly functions that may conditionally terminate the external\nEVM call using the `return()` or `stop()` opcode.\n\nSee the security alert post on [Storage Write Removal Bug On Conditional Early Termination](/2022/09/08/storage-write-removal-before-conditional-termination/)\nfor more information.\n\n## Full Changelog\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n\n- Yul Optimizer: Prevent the incorrect removal of storage writes before calls to Yul functions that conditionally terminate the external EVM call.\n\nCompiler Features:\n\n- Code Generator: More efficient overflow checks for multiplication.\n- Language Server: Analyze all files in a project by default (can be customized by setting `'file-load-strategy'` to `'directly-opened-and-on-import'` in LSP settings object).\n- Yul Optimizer: Simplify the starting offset of zero-length operations to zero.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n- Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error on tuple assignments with invalid left-hand side.\n- Yul IR Code Generation: Fix internal compiler error when accessing the `.slot` member of a mapping through a storage reference in inline assembly.\n\nBuild System:\n\n- Allow disabling pedantic warnings and do not treat warnings as errors during compiler build when `-DPEDANTIC=OFF` flag is passed to CMake.\n- Update emscripten to version 3.1.19.\n\nA big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!\nDownload the new version of Solidity here:
