This can be either by it leaking money, a specific account being able to withdraw all money or something else you can think of. You can also add a flaw to a token implementation you provide instead of to the exchange itself. The only hard requirement is that the flaw is hidden.\n\n## The Judges ‚öñÔ∏è\n\nJudges are presented with anonymised submissions. This year, the submissions will be assessed by:\n\n- [Alex Beregszaszi](https://twitter.com/alexberegszaszi), Solidity Co-Lead at Ethereum Foundation.\n- [Anton Permenev](https://twitter.com/a_permenev), Senior Engineer at ChainSecurity.\n- [Duncan Townsend](https://twitter.com/duncancmt), CTO at Immunefi.\n- [Gon√ßalo S√°](https://twitter.com/GNSPS), Security Engineer at ConsenSys Diligence.\n- [Harikrishnan Mulackal](https://twitter.com/_hrkrshnn), C++ Engineer Solidity at Ethereum Foundation.\n- [Josselin Feist](https://twitter.com/Montyly), Principal Security Engineer at Trail of Bits.\n- [samczsun](https://twitter.com/samczsun), Research Partner at Paradigm.\n- [Stefan Beyer](https://twitter.com/beyer_st), Lead Auditor at Solidified.\n\n### Judging Criteria ‚òëÔ∏è\n\nRember to consider the following aspects and properties for your submissions:\n\n- **Simplicity & Conciseness**: Since it's much easier to hide a vulnerability in complex and poorly written code, short and clean submissions will be scored higher than those that are lengthy and complicated.\n- **Plausibility**: Code that drops down to inline assembly without any clear reason why will look immediately suspicious, no matter how cleverly written the assembly-level flaw is.\n- **Originality**: Truly original ideas will receive more points than making use of already well known exploit/backdoor mechanisms.\n\n## The Prizes üèÜ\n\nThis year, the first place will receive a ticket to [Devcon VII Bogota](https://devcon.org/).\n\nThe top 3 submissions will receive a ticket to the [Devconnect Coworking Space](https://devconnect.org/) and the opportunity to present their contest submission at the [Solidity Summit 2022](https://summit.soliditylang.org/) in Amsterdam.\n\nThe top 3 submissions of the Underhanded Solidity Contest will also be awarded points for the upcoming [Paradigm CTF 2022](https://ctf.paradigm.xyz/).\nThose points will be awarded as though the winners solved a bonus challenge (\"pseudo-challenge\").\n\nFurthermore, the three winners will be added to the Board of Fame.\n\nThe winners and all qualified submissions will receive a custom Underhanded Solidity Contest NFT.\n\n## The Submission üì®\n\nBefore submitting your code ensure that:\n\n- The entirety of your submission is licensed under an open-source license.\n- In your submission you use Solidity v0.8.0 or newer.\n- You have carefully read the [Coding Brief](https://underhanded.soliditylang.org/#coding-brief).\n\nPlease email your submissions before the deadline [2022-03-16, 11:59PM UTC] to `sol_underhanded@ethereum.org`. Entries should consist of a ZIP file containing a README describing your submission and how it works, a separate file for spoilers, and one or more Solidity files.\n\nEach person can only enter one submission. If you want to make a team submission, nominate a single person to submit on your team's behalf. Since entries will be forwarded to the judges and assessed anonymously, please do not include identifying information in the ZIP file.\n\n## The Deadline ‚è≥\n\n- Submissions open: 2022-02-09.\n- Submissions close: 2022-03-16.\n\nWinners will be announced in time before Devconnect Amsterdam in April.\n\n## The Board of Fame ‚≠ê\n\nTo honor all winners of previous Underhanded Solidity Contests, we have introduced the [Board of Fame](https://underhanded.soliditylang.org/#board-of-fame). Consider checking out the hacks of previous winners for inspiration and to make sure you are not using an already known exploit by accident.\n\n## The Supporters üíñ\n\nLast but not least, we'd like to extend our thanks to [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/), [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/), [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/), [Solidified](https://solidified.io/), [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/), the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) and all the judges for their support in organizing this contest!\n\nShould you have any questions or encounter problems please feel free to reach out to us via `sol_underhanded@ethereum.org` or join the Solidity [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im) / [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) channel.\n\n**We‚Äôre looking forward to receiving many innocent submissions. üòá Have fun!**\n","availableURLs":["/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement","/2023/03/10/solidity-developer-survey-2022-results","/2023/02/22/user-defined-operators","/2023/02/22/solidity-0.8.19-release-announcement","/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement","/2022/12/07/solidity-developer-survey-2022-announcement","/2022/12/05/solidity-core-team-updates","/2022/09/08/storage-write-removal-before-conditional-termination","/2022/09/08/solidity-0.8.17-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/calldata-tuple-reencoding-head-overflow-bug","/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement","/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug","/2022/06/15/dirty-bytes-array-to-storage-bug","/2022/05/17/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement","/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug","/2022/05/17/calldata-reencode-size-check-bug","/2022/05/03/solidity-summit-2022-recap","/2022/04/08/announcing-the-underhanded-contest-winners-2022","/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement","/2022/03/16/encodecall-bug","/2022/02/22/solidity-summit-2022-announcement","/2022/02/16/solidity-0.8.12-release-announcement","/2022/02/09/underhanded-solidity-contest-2022-announcement","/2022/02/07/solidity-developer-survey-2021-results","/2021/12/20/solidity-0.8.11-release-announcement","/2021/11/18/solidity-developer-survey-2021","/2021/11/09/solidity-0.8.10-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/user-defined-value-types-bug","/2021/09/29/solidity-0.8.9-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/signed-immutables-bug","/2021/09/27/user-defined-value-types","/2021/09/27/solidity-0.8.8-release-announcement","/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement","/2021/06/22/solidity-0.8.6-release-announcement","/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement","/2021/05/03/soliditylangorg-umbrella-domain","/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement","/2021/04/21/decoding-from-memory-bug","/2021/04/21/custom-errors","/2021/04/01/announcing-solidity-collectibles","/2021/03/23/solidity-0.8.3-release-announcement","/2021/03/23/keccak-optimizer-bug","/2021/03/02/solidity-0.8.2-release-announcement","/2021/03/02/saving-gas-with-simple-inliner","/2021/02/15/contributing-to-solidity-101","/2021/02/10/an-introduction-to-soliditys-fuzz-testing-approach","/2021/02/01/launching-the-solidity-forum","/2021/01/27/solidity-0.8.1-release-announcement","/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results","/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement","/2020/12/16/solidity-0.7.6-release-announcement","/2020/12/09/solidity-developer-survey-2020","/2020/12/03/solidity-underhanded-contest-winners","/2020/11/18/solidity-0.7.5-release-announcement","/2020/11/04/solidity-ama-1-recap","/2020/10/28/solidity-0.8.x-preview","/2020/10/19/solidity-0.7.4-release-announcement","/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-0.7.3-release-announcement","/2020/09/28/solidity-0.7.2-release-announcement","/2020/09/21/solidity-underhanded-contest","/2020/09/18/meet-the-team","/2020/09/02/solidity-0.7.1-release-announcement","/2020/07/28/solidity-v0.7.0-release-announcement","/2020/07/22/Solidity-0612-release-announcement","/2020/07/08/solidity-turns-5","/2020/07/07/Solidity-0611-release-announcement","/2020/06/25/sourcify-faq","/2020/06/18/solidity-0.6-inheritance","/2020/06/11/Solidity-0610-release-announcement","/2020/06/09/solidity-summit-recap","/2020/06/05/Solidity-069-release-announcement","/2020/06/02/Sourcify-Towards-Safer-Contract-Interaction-for-Humans","/2020/05/26/array-slices","/2020/05/14/Solidity-068-release-announcement","/2020/05/13/immutable-keyword","/2020/05/04/solidity-0.6.7-release-announcement","/2020/04/17/Solidity-Summit-2020-Goes-Interspace","/2020/04/09/solidity-0.6.6-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/solidity-0.6.5-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug","/2020/03/23/fallback-receive-split","/2020/03/17/solidity-0.5.17-release-announcement","/2020/03/10/solidity-0.6.4-release-announcement","/2020/02/18/solidity-0.6.3-release-announcement","/2020/01/29/solidity-0.6-try-catch","/2020/01/27/solidity-0.6.2-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.6.1-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.5.16-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.6.0-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.5.15-release-announcement","/2019/12/09/solidity-0.5.14-release-announcement","/2019/11/14/solidity-0.5.13-release-announcement","/2019/10/01/solidity-0.5.12-release-announcement","/2019/08/12/solidity-0.5.11-release-announcement","/2019/06/25/solidity-storage-array-bugs","/2019/06/25/solidity-0.5.10-release-announcement","/2019/05/28/solidity-0.5.9-release-announcement","/2019/04/30/solidity-0.5.8-release-announcement","/2019/04/29/solidity-0.4.26-release-announcement","/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug","/2019/03/26/solidity-0.5.7-release-announcement","/2019/03/13/solidity-0.5.6-release-announcement
