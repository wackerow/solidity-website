{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","published":true,"title":"Solidity Dynamic Array Cleanup Bug","date":"2020-10-07","author":"Solidity Team","category":"Security Alerts"},"content":"\nOn September 17, 2020, a bug in the Solidity code generator was found. The bug is fixed with [version 0.7.3](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.3)\nreleased on October 7, 2020. **The bug is present in all prior versions of Solidity.**\n\nWe assigned the bug a severity level of \"medium\".\n\n## Technical Details of the Bug\n\n**Summary**: For a dynamically-sized storage-array with types of size at most 16 bytes,\nassignments that require deleting slots did not zero out the deleted slots properly.\n\nConsider a dynamically-sized array in storage whose base-type is small enough such that multiple\nvalues can be packed into a single slot, such as `uint128[]`. Let us define its length to be `l`.\nWhen this array gets assigned from another array with a smaller length, say `m`, the slots between\nelements `m` and `l` have to be cleaned by zeroing them out. However, this cleaning was not\nperformed properly. Specifically, after the slot corresponding to `m`, only the first packed value\nwas cleaned up. If this array gets resized to a length larger than `m`, the indices corresponding to\nthe unclean parts of the slot contained the original value, instead of 0. The resizing here is\nperformed by assigning to the array `length`, by a `push()` or via inline assembly.\n\nAn example of the bug is the following:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n// The bug is present in all versions of solidity prior to 0.7.3\npragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.7.3;\ncontract C {\n    uint128[] x;\n    function f() public {\n        x.push(42); x.push(42); x.push(42); x.push(42);\n        uint128[] memory y = new uint128[](1);\n        y[0] = 23;\n        // This will shrink the array x to one element.\n        x = y;\n        // Resizing the array to length 4.\n        x.push(); x.push(); x.push();\n        // After resizing the array, its contents are [23, 0, 0, 42],\n        // instead of [23, 0, 0, 0]. Resizing can be also be done by\n        // assigning to `.length` or by assigning to the `slot` member\n        // inside inline assembly.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## How to check if contract is vulnerable\n\nIf your contract does all of the following, try to run tests to see if your contract was relying on having elements in the resized part to be zero.\n\n1. The contract has a dynamically-sized array in storage whose base-type is of size at most 16 bytes.\n2. You perform an assignment to the aforementioned array by another array of smaller\n   length (from either memory, storage or calldata).\n3. You increase the length of the aforementioned array without assigning a value to the new elements.\n4. You read from one of the new elements before assigning a new value.\n\nYour contracts are not affected if you are only using `.push(<arg>)` or if you assign a value (even zero) to\nthe new elements after increasing the length of the array.\n","availableURLs":["/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement","/2023/03/10/solidity-developer-survey-2022-results","/2023/02/22/user-defined-operators","/2023/02/22/solidity-0.8.19-release-announcement","/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement","/2022/12/07/solidity-developer-survey-2022-announcement","/2022/12/05/solidity-core-team-updates","/2022/09/08/storage-write-removal-before-conditional-termination","/2022/09/08/solidity-0.8.17-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement","/2022/08/08/calldata-tuple-reencoding-head-overflow-bug","/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement","/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug","/2022/06/15/dirty-bytes-array-to-storage-bug","/2022/05/17/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement","/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug","/2022/05/17/calldata-reencode-size-check-bug","/2022/05/03/solidity-summit-2022-recap","/2022/04/08/announcing-the-underhanded-contest-winners-2022","/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement","/2022/03/16/encodecall-bug","/2022/02/22/solidity-summit-2022-announcement","/2022/02/16/solidity-0.8.12-release-announcement","/2022/02/09/underhanded-solidity-contest-2022-announcement","/2022/02/07/solidity-developer-survey-2021-results","/2021/12/20/solidity-0.8.11-release-announcement","/2021/11/18/solidity-developer-survey-2021","/2021/11/09/solidity-0.8.10-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/user-defined-value-types-bug","/2021/09/29/solidity-0.8.9-release-announcement","/2021/09/29/signed-immutables-bug","/2021/09/27/user-defined-value-types","/2021/09/27/solidity-0.8.8-release-announcement","/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement","/2021/06/22/solidity-0.8.6-release-announcement","/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement","/2021/05/03/soliditylangorg-umbrella-domain","/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement","/2021/04/21/decoding-from-memory-bug","/2021/04/21/custom-errors","/2021/04/01/announcing-solidity-collectibles","/2021/03/23/solidity-0.8.3-release-announcement","/2021/03/23/keccak-optimizer-bug","/2021/03/02/solidity-0.8.2-release-announcement","/2021/03/02/saving-gas-with-simple-inliner","/2021/02/15/contributing-to-solidity-101","/2021/02/10/an-introduction-to-soliditys-fuzz-testing-approach","/2021/02/01/launching-the-solidity-forum","/2021/01/27/solidity-0.8.1-release-announcement","/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results","/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement","/2020/12/16/solidity-0.7.6-release-announcement","/2020/12/09/solidity-developer-survey-2020","/2020/12/03/solidity-underhanded-contest-winners","/2020/11/18/solidity-0.7.5-release-announcement","/2020/11/04/solidity-ama-1-recap","/2020/10/28/solidity-0.8.x-preview","/2020/10/19/solidity-0.7.4-release-announcement","/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug","/2020/10/07/solidity-0.7.3-release-announcement","/2020/09/28/solidity-0.7.2-release-announcement","/2020/09/21/solidity-underhanded-contest","/2020/09/18/meet-the-team","/2020/09/02/solidity-0.7.1-release-announcement","/2020/07/28/solidity-v0.7.0-release-announcement","/2020/07/22/Solidity-0612-release-announcement","/2020/07/08/solidity-turns-5","/2020/07/07/Solidity-0611-release-announcement","/2020/06/25/sourcify-faq","/2020/06/18/solidity-0.6-inheritance","/2020/06/11/Solidity-0610-release-announcement","/2020/06/09/solidity-summit-recap","/2020/06/05/Solidity-069-release-announcement","/2020/06/02/Sourcify-Towards-Safer-Contract-Interaction-for-Humans","/2020/05/26/array-slices","/2020/05/14/Solidity-068-release-announcement","/2020/05/13/immutable-keyword","/2020/05/04/solidity-0.6.7-release-announcement","/2020/04/17/Solidity-Summit-2020-Goes-Interspace","/2020/04/09/solidity-0.6.6-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/solidity-0.6.5-release-announcement","/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug","/2020/03/23/fallback-receive-split","/2020/03/17/solidity-0.5.17-release-announcement","/2020/03/10/solidity-0.6.4-release-announcement","/2020/02/18/solidity-0.6.3-release-announcement","/2020/01/29/solidity-0.6-try-catch","/2020/01/27/solidity-0.6.2-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.6.1-release-announcement","/2020/01/02/solidity-0.5.16-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.6.0-release-announcement","/2019/12/17/solidity-0.5.15-release-announcement","/2019/12/09/solidity-0.5.14-release-announcement","/2019/11/14/solidity-0.5.13-release-announcement","/2019/10/01/solidity-0.5.12-release-announcement","/2019/08/12/solidity-0.5.11-release-announcement","/2019/06/25/solidity-storage-array-bugs","/2019/06/25/solidity-0.5.10-release-announcement","/2019/05/28/solidity-0.5.9-release-announcement","/2019/04/30/solidity-0.5.8-release-announcement","/2019/04/29/solidity-0.4.26-release-announcement","/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug","/2019/03/26/solidity-0.5.7-release-announcement","/2019/03/13/solidity-0.5.6-release-announcement
